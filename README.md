# Optimizing Random Vectors for Orthogonality 

Step 1: Initialize and Normalize Vectors

A random tensor (big_matrix) of size [250 x 10] is created, where 250 is the number of vectors and 10 is their dimension.

Each vector is normalized to have a unit length, ensuring they lie on the surface of a hypersphere.
